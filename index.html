<h2>About Me</h2>

<p class="about-text">
I’m a recent Computer Security & Networking graduate with hands-on experience in SOC labs, 
threat intelligence automation, and network monitoring. One of my main projects is a home Mini-SOC 
using Suricata and Splunk where I monitor traffic, tune detection rules, and build dashboards to better 
understand security events.
</p>

<p class="about-text">
I enjoy automating repetitive security tasks using Python, n8n, and lightweight AI integrations. 
Most of my work focuses on log correlation, alert triage, and building small tools that make investigations faster and clearer.
</p>

<p class="about-text">
My strongest interests are <strong>threat detection and incident response</strong>. 
I’ve documented investigations involving PowerShell activity, DNS tunneling behavior, and unusual IoT traffic, 
and I’ve spent time tuning rules to reduce false positives and improve signal quality.
